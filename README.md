Assignment done in my second year of university at the University of Sheffield where I had to code the Enigma Machine from the first World War and also the Bomber to decode messages encrypted by the Enigma Machine.

All code was done in Haskell, a functional programming language.

All code written by me is in the file Enigma.hs and the three Mian.hs files are used to test my solution.
